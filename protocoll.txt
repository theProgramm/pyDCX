The DCX2496 serial communication follows the midi sysex protocol.
Format is 38400 Bd, 8 databits, no parity, 1 stopbit. RTS gating on RS485.

Sysex command header:

hex(F0 00 20 32 [deviceId] 0E [command] [data] F7)

taken from midi sysex: F0 to F7 are the message bounds, the first 0 byte indicates its not a real time message, the 0x20 is a hardcoded MMC device id, the 0x32 is in place of the sub-id#1 denoting the used midi command with a value not specified by mid sysex. The device Id is in place of the sub-id#2. The midis parameter here is allways started with 0x0E and followed by a function byte and the data of that function.

this header is used both ways (for sending, recieving and returns)

device_id: one byte id for each device [0, 0xF](set on page 6 in the settings menu - starts at 1 in the settings menue which is 0 internaly)

Sending: 
known commands:
	0x3F: set transmitssion mode:
		data: 0x0400: receive direct parameter change enable
		data: 0x0800: transmit direct parameter change enable
		data 0x0C00: both
		no return
		the mode is kept f the device id changes
	
	0x40: "search"
		device_id < 0x0F: "search"for the denoted device - no result if device_id is not present
		device_id > 0xf: "search" any device regardless of its device_id.  (Possibly results in a "broadcast", possibly getting multiple device infos - so far only tested with one device)
		data: <empty>
		returns: device-id: device_id of the sending device, command: 0x00,
			data: <n> <device_info>{n}, <device_info> was allways "0x11DCX2496\n        \n " with software version 1.7 - possible with multiple devices this changes.
		this is usefull to detect the device_id of a connected device

	0x44: "ping" 
		data  = 0x0000 is sued by lasselukkari's duinodcx to get the current levels
		data != 0x0000 prouces somewhat different output 
		returns: device_id, device id of the sending device, command: 0x04
			data: <n><byte>*n
		somehow the bytes contain information about the current level and if a channel is limited, returned 0x10 bytes on the test device with 3 input + 6 output channels

	0x
